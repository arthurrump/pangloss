# Content

This is a test file for a (+pandoc) (+filter). (+^Filter) are pretty cool. This document has no (+^ilo), because it is just a test file. The reader is not supposed to learn anything from this. Then I mention an (+ilo) again. In this sentence I finish by forcing the long form of that concept: (+-ilo).

Weird things may happen is a term is included in another word, like with test(+pandoc), (+pandoc)(+filter) or (+pandoc)-(+filter).
